  <p>
    Provides the classes for generating source code in a target
    from an SMC
    {@link net.sf.smc.model.SmcFSM finite state machine model}
    instance. SMC uses the
    {@link net.sf.smc.parser.SmcParser} to produce the model but
    the model may be produced by other means such as by reading
    in an XML state machine definition.
