    Provides the classes for parsing an SMC text definition into
    a {@link net.sf.smc.model.SmcFSM finite state machine model}
    instance. This model is used by an SMC
    {@link net.sf.smc.generator.SmcCodeGenerator source code generator}
    to produce the target source code. Other model uses would be
    to produce a UML diagram, calculate statistics and optimize
    the state machine.
