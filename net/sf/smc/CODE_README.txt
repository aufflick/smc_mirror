                              SMC -
                  The State Machine Compiler
                        Version 6.2.0


+ Major changes
---------------

(All)
    SMC is now compiled with Java 1.7 and requires JRE 1.7 or
    better to run.

(SMC Language)
    The Default state is explicitly not allowed to have Entry and
    Exit action blocks. This is because "Default" is not an
    actual state but a psuedo-state used to start default
    transition definitions.

    Previously, Entry and Exit blocks could be defined for the
    Default state but nothing was done with them. Now these
    definitions will cause a compile error.

    Added "getStates" method for retrieving the finite state
    machine's states.

(All)
    Enhance debugging output by adding command line options -g0
    and -g1 which provide ever greater debug output. -g is the
    same as -g0. -g0 reports the exiting and entering a state,
    entering and exiting a transtion. -g1 reports exit and entry
    action execution.

(C#, VB.Net)
    Added -generic support to these languages.

+ Major changes
---------------

(All)
    Smc.jar requires Java 6.

(All)
    Moved source files into three separate directories: model,
    parser and generator. The model directory contains
    SmcElement.java and those classes extending SmcElement.
    The parser directory contains the classes for parsing a .sm
    file. The generator directory contains SmcCodeGenerator.java
    and those classes extending SmcCodeGenerator. Only Smc.java
    and SmcSyntaxChecker.java remains in the original source
    directory.

    There are four jar files built: the original Smc.jar,
    model.jar, parser.jar and generator.jar. Smc.jar uses the
    other three packages to implement the State Machine Compiler.
    The point of dividing SMC into different packages is to open
    SMC's capabilities to other applications. For example, if an
    IDE defines a the finite state machine using the model
    package then the generator package to emit the FSM in a
    target programming language. The new jar files are placed
    in lib/Java.

    This change in source file location does not otherwise affect
    how SMC works.

(All)
    The loopback transition is now divided into external and
    internal loopback transitions. The external loopback is
    specified by using the current state's name as the
    transition's next state. The external loopback executes the
    current state's exit and entry actions. The internal loopback
    uses "nil" as the next state and does not execute the current
    state's exit and entry actions. The internal loopback's
    behavior is the same as the previous loopback transition.

    NOTE: THIS CHANGE MAY BREAK EXISTING CODE.
    If you implemented loopbacks by placing the current state's
    name in the transition next state, then the transition's
    behavior will change. You will need to replace the explicit
    state name with "nil" to maintain existing behavior.
    (SF Feature Request 1876271)

(All)
    The SMC distribution now generates javadocs and places the
    generated HTML files in docs/javadocs. All SMC source files
    now have javadoc comments.

+ Minor changes
---------------

(C#, VB.Net)
    Added state change event support using .Net events and
    delegates. There was already some support for this in
    the generated C# code but it worked only for vanilla
    transitions. The state change event is now raised by
    statemap.FSMContext class for all transition types.

    Strangely, the C# generated code did not call
    statemap.FSMContext.SetState but access _state
    directly. This is now corrected.

+ Minor changes
---------------

(C#, VB) The _debugFlag and _debugStream are deprecated and no
         longer used. Instead, System.Diagnostics.Trace is
         used. The SMC programmer is responsible for defining
         the TRACE directive during compilation so the Trace
         will be included in the executable.

         The SMC programmer is also responsible for configuring
         Trace to send the trace output to the desired
         destination.

         There are no longer separate C# and VB dlls but a
         single lib/DotNet directory containing four DLLs:
         + debug with Trace support,
         + debug without Trace support,

+ Major changes
---------------

None.

+ Minor changes
---------------

(Java) Added FSM constructor which takes two arguments:
the FSM owner and an initial state. Changed state singletons
from package-level statics to public-level static finals so
application code may access them. For example, the state

    MyMap::Connected

is referenced as

    AppClassContext.MyMap.Connected.


+ Bug fixes
-----------

(C#) Corrected error in state Entry and Exit actions where the
context class was set to "null".

(C#) Added property debugStream which allows the debug output
TextWriter to be application-defined. By default the debug
stream is null and no output is written. Turning on debugging
in C# requires setting the Debug property to true and setting
the DebugStream property to a TextWriter object.

(C#, VB) Modified FSM serialization to follow .Net scheme.

(C++) Corrected FSMContext destructor and setDebugFlag method
which delete the _transition pointer even though FSMContext did
not allocate the memory.

(C++) Replaced strcpy calls with strncpy. State and transition
names are now limited to 100 characters by default. However,
this limit can be changed by modifying the statemap.h file.

(Perl) Corrected error where $ctxt variable was not defined
when necessary.

(Python) Corrected code indentation. Incorrect indentation is
a syntax error in Python.

---------------

Added -reflect option for Java, C#, VB.Net and Tcl code
generation. When used, allows applications to query a state
about its supported transitions. Returns a list of transition
names. This feature is useful to GUI developers who want to
enable/disable features based on the current state. See
Programmer's Manual section 11: On Reflection for more
information.

Updated LICENSE.txt with a missing final paragraph which allows
MPL 1.1 covered code to work with the GNU GPL.

Moved

    private static void _outputMessages(String, List)

to

    public static void outputMessages(String, PrintStream, List)

Compiler messages are now written to the specified
java.io.PrintStream rather than System.err. Also making this
method public allows other SMC tools to access it

                  The State Machine Compiler
                        Version 4.0.0



+ Major changes
---------------

Moved to Visitor pattern. By rearranging the SMC source code to
the Visitor pattern, it makes it easier to in new code generators
and code analyzers. See http://smc.sourceforge.net/????
for more information about how to add new code generators to SMC.

Added Python code generation. This capability and examples
provided by Francois Perrad, francois.perrad@gadz.org.

When SMC generates C++ and exceptions are allowed (when -noex is
*not* specified), then statemap::FSMContext::popState() throws
a PopOnEmptyStateStackException when a pop transition is taken
but the state stack is empty. Otherwise, assert() is used.

Added a -return command line option which causes Smc.main() to
return rather than exit. This option is needed by ANT users.


+ Bug fixes
-----------

(C++) In statemap.h, the variable id and _id were changed to
stateId and _stateId, respectively. This change was also made to
the generated C++ code. This change was made due to "id" being
a keyword in the Macintosh Objective-C++ language.

Corrected error when multiple spaces between %header, %import,
%include and %declare keywords and the following name caused
an unhandled exception.

Corrected errors with % keywords and the -graph target.

(C++) The hybrid Object-C++ language has the reserved word
"id". SMC generated C++ code contains this keyword as well
as statemap.h. SMC now uses "stateId".

(Java) Corrected error in generated serialization code. The
readObject() method was not restoring the current state. The
generated Java serialization code is now completely redone and
tested.

(Java) SMC now requires that the .sm source file has the same
basename as the context class' .java source file. So if the
context class is OrderConnection and is in OrderConnection.java,
then the associated FSM must be in OrderConnection.sm.

(Ant) Corrected a syntax error in examples/Ant/EX7/build.xml.

(C++) When the .sm is in a subdirectory the slashes in the file
name are kept in the "#ifndef" in the generated header file. This
is syntactically wrong. SMC now replaces the slashes with
underscores.

Added -graph option which generates a Graphviz/DOT representation
of the .sm finite state machine.


+ Bug fixes
-----------

Corrected errors in the example Ant build.xml files which
prevented the examples from building on Windows.

SMC is now unicode-compatible. A .sm file may contain unicode
characters but must still be a plain text file.

(-csharp) Corrected an error which caused a state's entry actions
to be generated in the place of its exit actions.

+ Major changes
---------------

No new features.


+ Bug fixes
-----------

Fixed error when reading in .sm files larger than 4,096 bytes.
SMC reads in 4,096 bytes at a time into an internal buffer,
overwritting the buffer's previous contents.
SMC will "back up" its buffer index when it decides a character
does not belong to the current lexical token. The bug occurrs
when SMC backs up past index 0. This has been corrected by
keeping the previous buffer's last two bytes available when
reading the next 4,096 bytes (SMC backs up at most 2 bytes.)

(-c++) Removed "using namespace std" from the "-g" generated
.cpp file. All generated references to the std namespace are
now fully-qualified with "std::".

Note: This means any std namespace references in your SMC
      code must be fully-qualified as well. SMC will not
      add the "std::" scoping for you.

                        Version 3.1.0



+ Major changes
---------------

Added C# target language.

Added "property = value" action to SMC syntax. This supports the
VB.net and C# property assignment syntax.

Added guards to Default transitions. However, Default transitions
still may not have parameters.

Added "-verbose" option which causes SMC to output messages as it
compiles.

Added "-d  directory" option which tells SMC where to place
generated files. Default is in the same directory as the .sm
file.


+ Bug fixes
-----------

Fixed error with TRACE macro in statemap.h.

Fixed error when compiling -c++ and .sm file is in another
directory. For example: java -jar Smc.jar -c++ src/AppClass.sm
generates an invalid AppClass_sm.h file.

Fixed error in Smc.main() which reports ParseExceptions as SMC
bugs. They are not. They are legitimate errors in the FSM code.

+ Major changes
---------------

Added VB.net target language.


+ Bug fixes
-----------

Fixed error where %include was flagged as wrong when -table is
set.

SMC now generates private default and copy constructors for C++.
Because the statemap::State has private default and copy
constructors, compiler-generated constructors cannot access them
which generates a warning. Having SMC declare these constructors
clears that warning.

I have made the statemap.h's debug stream code conditional.
When the SMC -g flag is set, the appropriate #define is placed
in the generated code prior to including statemap.h. This way
only debug code turns on the debug output.



                              SMC -

                        Version 2.2.0



+ Major changes
---------------

No major changes in this release.


+ Minor changes
---------------

Added the "-cast <cast_type>" command line option. Usable only
with the "-c++", it tells SMC how to downcast the current state
object to a subcalss. SMC uses dynamic_cast<> by default but
this requires runtime type information (RTTI) to be generated
by the C++ compiler. If RTTI is not generated, then
dynamic_cast<> cannot be used and either static_cast<> or
reinterpret_cast<> must be used.

Added the "-nocatch" command line option. SMC-generated code
uses a try/catch/rethrow block to protect the FSM against
application-thrown exceptions. This guarantees the FSM's state
is set before leaving the transition method. If the FSM's state
were left unset, the FSM becomes unusable.

However, certain applications cannot afford this overhead. The
"-nocatch" option prevents this try/catch/rethrow code from
being generated. Some developers thought the "-noex" option
performed this function. The "-noex" option only prevents
SMC-generated code from initiating exceptions.

Added the "-serial" command line option. This causes SMC to
associate a unique 4-byte integer ID with each state. When
storing an FSM, you need to store the current state and the
state stack (if you are using push/pop transitions). So you
store each state's unique integer ID. On restore, you use
the application context class' valueOf() method to convert
the integer ID back into a state object reference.


+ Bug fixes
-----------

SMC generated the local ctxt variable even though it was never
used. When that is the case, the ctxt variable is no longer
defined.

SMC reports an error when parsing a .sm file with a %header
construct and a -table target. The error states that %header
can only be used with a -c++ target. This is not true. It
can also be used with -table.



                              SMC -

                        Version 2.1.0



+ Major changes
---------------

Added the "-table" command line option. This tells SMC to
generate an HTML table from the .sm file. The table header is:

State     Entry             Transition
        Entry Exit  (One subheader for each)

Each cell contains each guard, end state and action for the state
and transition. Remember: each state/transition pair may have
multiple guards and each guard may have a different end state
and actions.

The generated HTML table is rudimentary since my HTML skills are
rudimentary. This feature is alpha but I hope to receive some
pointers in how I can improve the table's implementation.


+ Minor changes
---------------

I have converted all files from the DOS file format to Unix.
This caused some problems especially for gmake 3.76.1 on Sun
Solaris 8.

I have also changed the source file download to include the bin
directory as well. Now if you download the source, you also have
the Smc.jar necessary to build the product.

The Java FSMContext class no longer automatically allocates the
state stack object. The state stack is only needed if your FSM
uses the push/pop transitions. The state stack is now allocated
when it is needed. In the C++ and Tcl version, the state stack
is implemented differently and this issue does not arise.


+ Bug fixes
-----------

Removed "using namespace std" from statemap.h. Placing
"using namespace ..." in a header file is bad C++. I also use
the new <cstdio>, etc. standard header files whereever
possible instead of the older <stdio.h>.

                  The State Machine Compiler
                        Version 2.0.2



+ Major changes
---------------

The SMC parser has been greatly simplified by reading in guard
conditions, transition parameter types and action arguments as
"raw" tokens rather than "cooked". "raw" means that the code
is read in verbatim from the .sm file and placed as-is into the
target source file and letting the source language compiler deal
with any errors.

SMC also has fewer classes to deal with. Instead of a separate
class for each target language (SmcMapCpp, SmcMapJava and
SmcMapTcl), there is only one class (SmcMap). SmcMap knows how
to generate code for a specific target language.

+ Minor changes
---------------

Placed the SMC executable JAR classes in package net.sf.smc.
NOTE: The statemap.jar package has *not* changed. The package
is still "statemap".

                        Version 1.0.1


+ Bug Fixes - Default transitions
---------------------------------

Modified generated code so that all default transitions are now
defined in the <appclass>State class and not in each of the
individual map classes. The resulting generated code is
equivalent to the previous code *except* it now throws a
TransitionUndefinedException when a transition is issued in a
map which does not define that exception. Also, the generated
code has been reduced and is easier to read.

Also updated generate [incr Tcl] code so that it is now
up-to-date with the C++ and Java class structure.


+ Bug Fixes - Generated Java code thread safe
---------------------------------------------

The generated Java code is now thread safe. Now the same state
machine can be accessed from multiple threads safely.

                      Version 1.0.0, Beta 4


+ Bug Fixes - Entry/Exit Actions
--------------------------------

SMC previously executed the current state's Exit actions and the
destination state's Entry actions on every transition.Experience
now shows that this is not correct behavior for loopback, push
and pop transitions. Entry and Exit actions are now executed
as follows, depending on the transition type:

+ Simple, non-loopback transition:
    1. Execute current state's Exit actions.
    2. Clear current state.
    3. Execute transition actions.
    4. Set current state to destination state.
    5. Execute destination state's Entry actions.

+ Loopback transition:
  Note: Entry and Exit actions *are* not executed.
    1. Save current state.
    2. Clear current state.
    3. Execute transition actions.
    4. Restore current state.

+ Push transition:
  Note: Only the Entry actions are executed.
    1. Push current state on top of state stack.
    2. Clear current state.
    3. Execute transition actions.
    4. Set current state to destination state.
    5. Execute destination state's Entry actions.

+ Pop transition:
  Note: Only the Exit actions are executed.
    1. Execute current state's Exit acions.
    2. Clear current state.
    3. Execute transition actions.
    4. Pop state off the top of the state stack and make it the
       current state.
    5. If the pop included a transition, issue that transition
       from the current state.

                      Version 1.0, Beta 3


+ New Feature - Transition Parameters
-------------------------------------

You can now pass parameters into a transtion. You specify a
transition's parameters using the following syntax:

    OnLogin(name: const char*, passwd: const char*, grp_id: int)
    [isLoginValid(name, passwd);]
        {startLoginShell(name, passwd, grp_id);}

    OnLogin(name: const char*, passwd: const char*, grp_id: int)
    [maxLoginAttemptsReached(name);]
        {disconnect();}

    OnLogin(name: const char*, passwd: const char*, grp_id: int)
        {displayLoginPrompt();}

The format is: <transition>[(var: type[, var: type]+)]
If the transition takes no parameters, you may omit the parens
"()". Empty parens work as well.

NOTE: When a transition has multiple definitions (as in the above
example), then each transition definition *must* have exactly the
same parameter list. Transitions with the same name but different
parameter lists are *different* transitions.



+ Almost Feature - Transition Queuing
-------------------------------------

I put a "transition queuing" feature into SMC wherein, if an
object issued a transition from within a transition, the new
transition is queued until the current transition completes.

While it seemed a code idea, it spawned evil code containing
insidous bugs that are difficult to find:

+ The overarching problem is that SMC leads you to believe that a
  transition has completly executed after the transition call
  returns. With transition queuing, this is simply not true. Code
  which depends on this "transition completed upon return" will
  perform incorrectly.

+ Transition queuing + transition parameters = Big Problems.
  Passing anything other than simple, built-in types to a
  queued transition is a recipe for disastor. I couldn't figure
  out a way to deep-copy the transition's arguments (because I am
  determined that SMC be target-language neutral), so I saved
  only the argument reference. But now the application developer
  must be careful not to delete the objects until after the
  transition has been taken. This means adding transition actions
  which delete the transition's arguments plus locating the
  arguments in persistent memory. Overall, very ugly.

So, I have decided to punt on transition queuing and leave it up
to the developer to handle this problem. Objects can now query
their state machine context to see if a transition is in progress:

    bool AppClassContext::isInTransition();

If the state machine is in transition, then true is returned. The
application must not issue a transition now and should queue up
that transition for later. If isInTransition() returns false,
then a transition may be issued.

I have added a lengthy discussion to the SMC Programmer's Manual
discussing how to develop state machines which avoid this
transition-within-transition problem. In fact, I describe how to
design state machines in general.
