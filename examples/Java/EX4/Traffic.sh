# Revision 1.5  2002/05/07 00:29:50  cwrapp
# Changes in release 1.3.2:
# Add the following feature:
# + 528321: Modified push transition syntax to be:
#
# 	  <transname> <state1>/push(<state2>)  {<actions>}
#
# 	  which means "transition to <state1> and then
# 	  immediately push to <state2>". The current
# 	  syntax:
#
# 	  <transname> push(<state2>)  {<actions>}
#
#           is still valid and <state1> is assumed to be "nil".
#
# No bug fixes.
#
# Revision 1.3  2001/12/14 20:10:37  cwrapp
# Changes in release 1.1.0:
# Add the following features:
# + 486786: Added the %package keyword which specifies the
#           Java package/C++ namespace/Tcl namespace
#           the SMC-generated classes will be placed.
# + 486471: The %class keyword accepts fully qualified
#           class names.
# + 491135: Add FSMContext methods getDebugStream and
#           setDebugStream.
# + 492165: Added -sync command line option which causes
#           the transition methods to be synchronized
#           (this option may only be used with -java).
#
# Revision 1.2  2001/05/09 23:40:02  cwrapp
# Changes in release 1.0, beta 6:
# Fixes the four following bugs:
# + 416011: SMC does not properly handle pop transitions which
#           have no argument.
# + 416013: SMC generated code does not throw a
#           "Transition Undefined" exception as per Programmer's
#           Manual.
# + 416014: The initial state's Entry actions are not being
#           executed.
# + 416015: When a transition has both a guarded and an unguarded
#           definition, the Exit actions are only called when the
#           guard evaluates to true.
# + 422795: SMC -tcl abnormally terminates.
#
# Revision 1.1.1.2  2001/03/26 14:41:47  cwrapp
# Corrected Entry/Exit action semantics. Exit actions are now
# executed only by simple transitions and pop transitions.
# Entry actions are executed by simple transitions and push
# transitions. Loopback transitions do not execute either Exit
# actions or entry actions. See SMC Programmer's manual for
# more information.

# SMC - The State Map Compiler
# Version: 1.0, Beta 3
#
# SMC compiles state map descriptions into a target object oriented

# SMC finite state machines have such features as:
# + Entry/Exit actions for states.
# + Transition guards
# + Transition arguments
# + Push and Pop transitions.
# + Default transitions.
